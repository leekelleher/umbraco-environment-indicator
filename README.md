When developing websites using Umbraco in multi-environment solution, you can often get confused which environment you are currently looking at.

As a visual aid, this package will add a colour-coded indicator in the CMS back-office - this is applied to both the favicon (in the browser tab/title-bar) and adds a stripe to your avatar (in the top-left navigation).

## Configuration

### Changing the colours

If you want to modify the default colours, you can do this by editing the `/App_Plugins/CmsEnvironmentIndicator/js/cms-environment-indicator.js` script.  You'll find a JavaScript array called `config`, there you can modify the existing colours and/or add new hostname/colour combinations.  The hostnames are defined as Regular Expressions, so don't forget to escape any dots, etc.
